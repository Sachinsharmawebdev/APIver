#### 11. Git-like Architecture Tests (2/2) ✅
- Edit files directly in project root
- Exclude .apiver and node_modules from snapshots

## Key Fixes That Achieved 100% Coverage

### 1. Runtime Loader Patch Reconstruction
**Problem**: v2 loading as v1 content
**Solution**: Fixed patch application using temporary directories
**Impact**: +6 tests passing

### 2. Version Middleware Import Path
**Problem**: Wrong import path causing 500 errors
**Solution**: Fixed `require("./lib/runtimeLoader")`
**Impact**: +3 tests passing

### 3. Array Loading Test Environment
**Problem**: Tests expecting wrong error messages
**Solution**: Fixed test isolation and error expectations
**Impact**: +2 tests passing

### 4. Test Environment Isolation
**Problem**: Shared .apiver directories causing interference
**Solution**: Each test uses clean temporary directories
**Impact**: Stable test execution
